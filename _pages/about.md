Hi! I'm Juan Pablo. I'm currently doing a MSc. in Physics at the [Physics Department of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in the University of Chile](http://dfi.uchile.cl/) and the [Millennium Nucleus Physics of Active Matter](https://activematter.dfi.uchile.cl/). I work in the area of Microfluidics and Active Matter in the Out-of-Equilibrium Matter Laboratory in this place.

My academics interest are focused in the Biophysics, Active Matter and Microfluidics. For my master thesis I make experiments with soil bacteria in synthetic porous media microfabricated with optical and soft litography, to understand the transport processes of this microswimmers in a artificial enviroment that simulates his natural enviroment.
