Hi! I am Juan Pablo. I am currently doing a Master's in Physics at the [University of Chile](http://dfi.uchile.cl/) and the [Millennium Nucleus Physics of Active Matter](https://activematter.dfi.uchile.cl/). I work in the Microfluidics and Active Matter area of the Out of Equilibrium Matter Laboratory housed at this university.

My academic interests are focused on Biophysics, Active Matter and Microfluidics. For my master's thesis I carry out experiments with soil bacteria in microfabricated synthetic porous media with optical and soft lithography. With them I study the transport processes of these biological microswimmers in an artificial environment that simulates their natural environment.
