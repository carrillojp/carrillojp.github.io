Hi! I am Juan Pablo. I am currently doing a Master's in Physics at the [University of Chile](http://dfi.uchile.cl/) and the [Millennium Nucleus Physics of Active Matter](https://activematter.dfi.uchile.cl/). I work in the Microfluidics and Active Matter area of the Laboratory of Matter Out-of-Equilibrium housed at the [Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, University of Chile](http://dfi.uchile.cl/investigacion/laboratorios-de-investigacion/laboratorio-de-materia-fuera-del-equilibrio.html).

My academic interests are focused on Biophysics, Active Matter and Microfluidics. For my master's thesis I carry out experiments with soil bacteria in microfabricated synthetic porous media with optical and soft lithography. With them I study the transport processes of these biological microswimmers in an artificial environment that simulates their natural environment.
