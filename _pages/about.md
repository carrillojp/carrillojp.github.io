Hi! I'm Juan Pablo, I'm currently doing a MSc. in Physics at the Physics Department of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in the University of Chile. I work in the Microfluidics and Active Matter Laboratory in this place, making experiments with soil bacteria in synthetic porous media microfabricated with optical and soft litography.
