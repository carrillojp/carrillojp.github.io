Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a soil bacterium that fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with soybean plants, being used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two different flagellar systems, a single thick subpolar flagellum, and several thin lateral flagella. We use microfabricated devices to imitate the soil's intricate structure to investigate the bacterial motility and the role of each flagellar system in a laboratory. In these devices we vary the confinement level to study its effect on the motility of these soil bacteria.
