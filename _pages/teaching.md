### **Transport Process of Soil Bacteria in Synthetic Porous Media**
###### <span style="color:orange"> **Keywords:** soil bacteria, motility, porous media, shear, diffusion </span>

Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a soil bacterium that fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with soybean plants, being used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two different flagellar systems, a single thick subpolar flagellum, and several thin lateral flagella. We use microfabricated devices to imitate the soil's intricate structure to investigate the bacterial motility and the role of each flagellar system in a laboratory. In these devices we vary the confinement level to study its effect on the motility and swimming strategies of these soil bacteria.

We studied the effective diffusion of these bacteria through these porous media experimentally and then contrasted the results with numerical simulations. We also expose these bacteria to different flows and studied the effect of shear stress on their motility and accumulation.

### **Chiral and Inertial Dry Active Matter**
###### <span style="color:orange"> **Keywords:** Hexbugs, chiral active matter, inertial active matter, dry active matter </span>

HexBugs are small robots that move like chiral active Brownian particles with inertia. With these active agents, as occurs at low Reynolds with bacteria, the geometry of the walls with which they interact and that confine them affects the characteristics of their movement and aggregation. In this joint work with Edgardo Rosas, initially exploratory, we seek to contrast various previously reported results for active matter without inertia with results obtained from experiments with Hexbugs.

### **Entropy Production by transmembrane ionic flows**
###### <span style="color:orange"> **Keywords:** excitable cells, out of equilibrium systems, disipative structure </span>

In this work we study the entropy production by transmembrane ionic flows using non-equilibrium thermodynamics for dissipative structures. We derive an equation for the production of entropy that joins the system of equations of the generalized Hodgkin-Huxley model that describes the dynamics of the membrane potential in electrically excitable cells. And from numerical simulations we characterize the production of entropy in a neuronal cell that is in different states of activity.
